<br>
An multipurpose timetable planner, task-manager and calendar app for NTU students on Android.
<br>

## Introduction

The idea of this mobile app is to be a task manager and calendar specifically designed for students to keep track of their timetable schedules and assignment deadlines, by adding features that I would personally find useful:

1) Usually, entering a timetable into an ordinary calendar app is tedious as it repeats weekly. 
2) It would be great to keep track of any lesson changes (change in location, lesson cancelled etc) more easily. 
3) When entering a new task, be able to assign it to a particular upcoming lesson.

## Features

1) Search for a module with it's various indexes and exam
2) Plan timetable and save it
3) Keep track of lessons in the calendar
4) Task manager
